# NPC-Medic
This script is a custom medic treatment sequence using animations and peds.

Script Description

This allows people to use medic NPCs for example no medics are online, they can then go and pay these NPC's to give them treatment instead of being at low hp.

You can also get a friend thereby carrying him there, then let him use the medic.

 

The ped will carry you onto a random bed, here you will receive treatment for a certain amount of time (specified in the config). Then get revived and set to max health. Price is configurable.

 

Requirements
